# Code of Conduct - ServerUtils

## Our Goal

We want the ServerUtils project to be a welcoming and friendly place for everyone interested in contributing or using these scripts. We encourage collaboration and learning.

## Expected Behavior

To help achieve this, we ask everyone interacting with the project (on GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, etc.) to:

* **Be Respectful:** Treat others with courtesy. Different opinions and experience levels are welcome.
* **Be Kind:** Assume good intent, offer constructive feedback politely, and be considerate in your interactions.
* **Be Collaborative:** Work together constructively. Help each other out.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Behavior that is disrespectful, discriminatory, harassing, or otherwise unwelcoming will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive comments related to personal characteristics.
* Insults, trolling, or personal attacks.
* Harassment of any kind.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it directly to the project maintainer (`ShinniUwU`) via a GitHub Issue or direct contact through GitHub. All reports will be kept confidential to the extent possible and addressed seriously.

## Thanks!

Thank you for helping make ServerUtils a positive environment.
