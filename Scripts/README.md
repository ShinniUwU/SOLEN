# 🧩 Scripts

This directory contains categorized scripts for specific server tasks. Browse the folders below to find scripts for your needs. Each category folder contains its own `README.md` detailing the scripts within it.

Tip: Use the top-level `serverutils` runner to list and run any script without changing directories:

```
../serverutils list
../serverutils run <category/script-name>
```
