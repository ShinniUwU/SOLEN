# SOLEN Health thresholds (scaffold)
# Parser behavior:
#  - If 'yq' is installed, thresholds are read via yq (supports standard YAML).
#  - If 'yq' is not present, a lightweight awk fallback supports the inline
#    shapes used below (flat threshold keys and inline service allow list).

thresholds:
  disk_root_pct:
    warn: 85
    error: 95
  load15_per_core:
    warn: 1.0
    error: 2.0
  mem_pressure_pct:
    warn: 70
    error: 85
services:
  # Inline list supported by awk fallback; multiline lists are supported when yq is available
  allow: ["sshd", "cron", "docker", "jellyfin"]
